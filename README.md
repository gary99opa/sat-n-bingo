Saturday Night Bingo by 9T9 Assembly Sig

Here is another great sample of TMS9900 Assembly Source Code, this was originally a disk release program by Texas Instruments in Extended Basic in 1980, and has been converted to Assembly most likely around year 1989 by the 9T9 Assembly Sig and Cecil G. Chin and now I have released it with permission to my O.P.A. GitHub and here on AtariAge as usual, and is a good example on how to use RND numbers, the PRINT device, SPEECH and VDP Sprites in Assembly.

Enjoy!
